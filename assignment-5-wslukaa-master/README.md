# COMP4651 Assignment-5 (8 marks)

### Deadline: Apr 23, 23:59 (Sunday)
---

In this assignment, you will write a Spark application to perform text analysis and entity resolution. This assignment repo consists of only one IPython notebook:

* `text_analysis_and_entity_resolution.ipynb`

**Note:** Make sure you have completed [this](https://course.cse.ust.hk/comp4651/assignments.html) self-paced Spark tutorial. We will be running the assignment notebook on **the same Spark VM** for the tutorial.

It is important to place the assignment .ipynb file to the **home directory** of your Spark VM: `/home/vagrant/`. You can `git clone` this assignment repo directly in Spark VM, and then copy the notebook file to `/home/vagrant/`.

The following instructions assume that you have successfully launched the Spark IPython Notebook engine and connected to its web UI using the browser of your choice on your *host machine*. If you don't know how, please refer to `README.md` file in the Git repo of the self-paced Spark tutorial.

## Text Analysis and Entity Resolution (**8 marks**)
Open the notebook file (`text_analysis_and_entity_resolution.ipynb`) in your web browser and follow the instructions carefully. Once you've done coding, you'll submit your Python code to GitHub for autograding. You'll also need to explain your code to TA in the lab on April 24.

### Grading
* **Autograding (4 marks)**: You need to download the assignment code from your IPython Notebook environment. In the notebook web UI, You can click on "File", then hovering your mouse over "Download as", and then clicking on "Python (.py)". This will export your IPython Notebook as a `text_analysis_and_entity_resolution.py` file to your computer. You can `git add` this file, then commit and push it to GitHub to submit your code.
* **Code explaination (4 marks)**: In the lab session on April 24, the TA will ask you to explain your code.

Please be reminded that the autograder will give an *all-or-nothing* mark. That is, you will not get any marks unless you have successfully completed **all** parts of this coding task.
